      <description>Last week, I gave a presentation at the once-a-semester AMOS Day event, where researchers from AMOS at NTNU get together to discuss their projects.
The focus of my talk was the hyperspectral camera that the NTNU small satellite team has been working on. I focused on two of our interesting findings that I and a collegue presented at conferences earlier this year.
First, I spoke about a fast resampling procedure that we developed to correct for smile and keystone in spectrograms.</description>
