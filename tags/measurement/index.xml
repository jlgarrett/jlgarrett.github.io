      <description>A paper that I had written with a few colleagues from the University of Maryland was just published.
The article discusses the sensitivity and accuracy that we achieved (at UMD) in measurements of the Casimir force in air and discusses they might be improved.
I wrote this paper with future graduate students as the target audience. In one sense, it is everything that I wish I knew about how to measure the Casimir force before starting a PhD studying it.</description>
