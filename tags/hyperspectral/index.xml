      <description>A paper authored by one of the masters students whom I co-advised (and co-authored by myself) has recently been published.
We investigated the possibility of using a shallow neural network, called a self-organizing map, as a way of clustering hyperspectral data on-board the HYPSO cubesat.
Clustering is a very flexible operation in machine learning which can pre-process data so that it can be analyzed by other algorithms more easily. For example, because clustering groups similar pixels together, a classification algorithm can operate more quickly by analysing the clusters (a few hundred) rather than the individual pixels (a few hundred thousand), which provides a significant speed improvement.</description>

      <description>Last week, I gave a presentation at the once-a-semester AMOS Day event, where researchers from AMOS at NTNU get together to discuss their projects.
The focus of my talk was the hyperspectral camera that the NTNU small satellite team has been working on. I focused on two of our interesting findings that I and a collegue presented at conferences earlier this year.
First, I spoke about a fast resampling procedure that we developed to correct for smile and keystone in spectrograms.</description>
