      <description>A paper authored by one of the masters students whom I co-advised (and co-authored by myself) has recently been published.
We investigated the possibility of using a shallow neural network, called a self-organizing map, as a way of clustering hyperspectral data on-board the HYPSO cubesat.
Clustering is a very flexible operation in machine learning which can pre-process data so that it can be analyzed by other algorithms more easily. For example, because clustering groups similar pixels together, a classification algorithm can operate more quickly by analysing the clusters (a few hundred) rather than the individual pixels (a few hundred thousand), which provides a significant speed improvement.</description>
