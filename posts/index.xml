      <description>Can I still change this?
I am making this website to: [a] experiment with making a website [b] write a little about the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on [c] link the projects to repositories I developed for them [d] share occassional advice or thoughts about science &amp;amp; technology
Most of my software experience pertains to either running equipment, performing data analysis (primarily on images), or running simulations. Websites are new to me &amp;ndash; at least on the development side :) I read a little about a few different static site generators, and decided that Hugo would be the most fun to learn.</description>
